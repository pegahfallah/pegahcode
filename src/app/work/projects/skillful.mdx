# DBT Companion App for Emotional Wellness

## Overview

Skillful is a DBT (Dialectical Behavior Therapy) companion app specifically designed to support people with BPD and anyone practicing DBT skills. The app offers a modern approach to emotional wellness through quick check-ins, personalized skill tracking, and always-free crisis tools. Built with the understanding that you can't use your prefrontal cortex when you're drowning, Skillful helps users build muscle memory during calm moments so their body knows what to do automatically during crisis.

## Traction

Received **150 visitors** since launch.

## Key Features

### Quick Check-in
30-second emotion logging with an intuitive emotion wheel, intensity slider, and optional trigger tags—designed for impaired cognitive states with large touch targets and minimal decision points.

### DBT Skills Library
Comprehensive coverage of all four DBT modules: Distress Tolerance, Emotion Regulation, Interpersonal Effectiveness, and Mindfulness. Each skill includes plain-language explanations, guided exercises, and "Did this help?" tracking.

### Personal Safety Plan
Pre-built crisis plan users fill out during calm moments—warning signs, coping strategies, support contacts, and one-tap access to 988 Lifeline. Works offline, accessible from anywhere in the app.

### Skill Effectiveness Tracking
The app learns what works for each user. "TIPP helped 85% of the time when you felt panic" becomes personalized insight that informs future skill suggestions.

### Pattern Dashboard
Calendar heatmap of mood entries, weekly/monthly trends, and correlations between mood, time of day, triggers, and specific people—because you can't shift what you don't see.
