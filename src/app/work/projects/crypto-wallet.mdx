# Cryptographic Wallet

## Overview

A collection of cryptographic wallet implementations demonstrating core blockchain security concepts. The project includes a basic cryptographic wallet for key generation, message signing, and encryption, as well as a Bitcoin HD (Hierarchical Deterministic) wallet implementation following BIP-32 and BIP-39 standards.

## Cryptographic Wallet

### Capabilities
- Generate public and private key pairs
- Encrypt user input data
- Sign messages with private key
- Verify signatures with public key
- Decrypt encrypted messages

### Usage
```bash
node wallet.js
```

## Bitcoin HD Wallet

An HD wallet is a public/private key tree structure where each node extends to a private and public key starting from the root. The master private key generates key pairs rather than signing transactions directly. This implementation is compatible with Bitcoin.

### Usage
```bash
npm install
npm run start
```

## Technologies Used

```typescript
const techStack = {
  runtime: ['Node.js', 'TypeScript'],
  cryptography: ['Node.js crypto library'],
  bitcoin: ['bip39', 'hdkey', 'create-hash', 'bs58check']
}
```
