# Minefront

## Overview

A 3D game developed entirely from scratch in Java without using any game engines. This project was a deep dive into the fundamentals of game development, from rendering 3D graphics to handling user inputs and optimizing performance.

## What I Learned

- **Java Project Structure** - Organizing a complex codebase with multiple systems working together
- **User Input Handling** - Processing keyboard and mouse inputs for smooth gameplay
- **Java Animations** - Creating fluid animations and visual effects
- **3D Game Development** - Building a 3D rendering system from the ground up
- **FPS and Optimization** - Managing frame rates and program efficiency

## Technologies Used

```typescript
const techStack = {
  language: ['Java'],
  concepts: ['3D Rendering', 'Game Loop', 'Input Systems', 'Performance Optimization']
}
```
