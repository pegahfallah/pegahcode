# UGC Creator: Authentic Content for Brands

## Overview

I work with brands to produce user-generated style content designed for TikTok and Instagram. My videos are shot and edited to match platform-native trends while staying aligned with brand voice and campaign goals. This approach helps brands connect with audiences in a way that feels authentic, engaging, and built for virality.

## Content Toolkit

```typescript
const contentStack = {
  production: ['TikTok', 'Instagram Reels', 'Short-Form Editing'],
  editing: ['CapCut', 'Premiere Pro', 'After Effects'],
  skills: ['Scriptwriting', 'Storyboarding', 'Trend Research'],
  strategy: ['Content Pillars', 'Hook Optimization', 'Campaign Alignment']
}
